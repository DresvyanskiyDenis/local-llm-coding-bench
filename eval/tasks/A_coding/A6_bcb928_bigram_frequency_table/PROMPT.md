# Task: implement `task_func` in `src/solution.py`

`src/solution.py` already holds the required imports and the exact function signature.
Replace its `raise NotImplementedError` body with a working implementation. Do not rename
the function, change the signature, or drop the imports that are already there.

## Specification

Create a dictionary containing all possible two-letter combinations of the lowercase English alphabets. The dictionary values represent the frequency of these two-letter combinations in the given word. If a combination does not appear in the word, its value will be 0.
The function should output with:
    dict: A dictionary with keys as two-letter alphabet combinations and values as their counts in the word.
You should write self-contained code starting with:
```
from collections import Counter
import itertools
import string
def task_func(word: str) -> dict:
```

## Done when

- `src/solution.py` defines a complete, working `task_func` (no `NotImplementedError` left).
- The module-level imports and the signature are unchanged from the ones you were given.
- The implementation runs offline: no network access, no interactive prompts.
